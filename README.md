# MapGenieProUnlock
Chrome extension that unlocks [Map Genie](https://mapgenie.io/) PRO features for free.<br>
The extension is only tested on the [DL2 villedor Map](https://mapgenie.io/dying-light-2/maps/villedor) and [Elden Ring Map](https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring)
and works fine so far. But I'm pretty sure it will work on other maps too.
The extenions should work on both the maps and the guides(tools).<br>
*NOTE: this is my first chrome extension I made, so don't mind the minor mistakes*

## What does it do
   Its basicly like a parasite takes control of the application and tells it what to do with the given data.
   It blocks a couple of API calls for saving the locations and categories.<br>
   And instead saves it in your local browser storage.<br>
   This enables the ability for tracking more then 100 locations and 2 categories.

## Installation
 * Install the zip file and unpack it.
 * And use this [Install upacked extension guide](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) to install it.
 * Its also recommended to clear your map data before using the extension.
